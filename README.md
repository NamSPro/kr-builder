# kr-builder

---

My attempt at creating a hero building sim for King's Raid.

### Current Version: none, in development

## Dependencies

1. [SDL2 2.0.14](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)
2. [SDL2_image 2.0.5](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/)
3. [SDL2_ttf 2.0.15](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/)

## Build

Built with mingw32-make 4.2.1 built for i686-w64-mingw32, using g++ (i686-posix-dwarf-rev0) 8.1.0.<br>
But I think it should work with any make/g++ version... Also remember to edit include/library paths in the Makefile before compiling!

The current build looks like [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/847884337399726130/861229874559713290/unknown.png)
